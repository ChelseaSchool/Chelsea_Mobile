## Stage 2: Content Management (user stories)

### Introduction to User Stories

By convention, the template is as follows. These statements combine to form what used to be called software requirements.

	As {some kind of user} I want to be able to {do something specific} for {these reasons}.

Creating user stories without collaboration with the stakeholders ultimately undermines the purpose of this development strategy.

Nevertheless, I'm putting forward some suggestions - please feedback.

#### Proposed User Stories

[ ] As a content administrator, I need a "control panel" through which I can easily manage content to prevent the user experience from becoming stale.

[ ] As a school administrator, I need access to the "control panel" to be highly secure to prevent the brand from being defaced or our organization's mission from being undermined.

[ ] As a content manager, I don't want a password stored in plain text because it would compromise the security of the site, database, and the organization's mission.

[ ] As an authorized administrator, I want a simple, password protected "control panel" to edit, amend, or otherwise manipulate a blog so I can provide frequent "news" updates to users.

[ ] As a content manager, I want to manipulate site *content* (edit or add) so it adds value to the site for users.

[ ] As a content manager, I want the option to write *content* (only content) in plain text to make content updates as fluid and efficient as possible.

[ ] As a content manager, I want the option to write *content* (only content) in HTML to make content updates as fluid and efficient as possible.


[ ] As a content manager, I want the option to write *content* (only content) in markdown to make content updates as fluid and efficient as possible.

[ ] As a systems administrator, I want to manipulate style & appearance by directly editing CSS/HTML5/PHP.

[ ] As a systems administrator, I want to update the code base via FTP (file transfer protocol) transactions with a shared host (Siteground is where our site is hosted) so I can squash bugs and make timely updates to the code.

[ ] As an ed administrator, I want to be able to rebrand the site to serve the mission of my organization.

[ ] As a Head of School, I want to be able to visibly express copyright of *content*.

[ ] As a photographer, I want credit for my work expressed.

[ ] As a developer and school administrator, I want the code base (not the content or photographs) shared with organizations via [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) license in order to develop a reputation for the organization as technology leaders.

[ ] As a content manager and school administrator, I want assurance that the mobile site developers will make every effort to make the site accessible so that it reaches precisely the audience whose attention we'd like.

[ ] As a guest, I want to access the site on a mobile phone using Firefox Mobile, Chrome, or Safari so that it can be frequently accessed from anywhere 3G and 4G is available for the compatible device.

[ ] As a Head of School, I want the login to be protected by SSL (secure HTTP) so privileged users' passwords can't be clearly read by outsiders.

[ ] As a content manager, I want to be able to manipulate site content with the assurance that I'm not interfering with style (appearance, theme) or structure.
